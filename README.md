This project simulates a real-world scenario where a wedding planner is tasked with preparing multiple event options for a client based on various wedding sizes and budget levels. The client seeks insights into pricing for small, medium, and large weddings, with categories ranging from inexpensive to luxury.

### Key SQL tasks include:
- Creating a temporary table (relevant_vendors) of vendors that match the wedding theme.
- Defining categorical attributes like wedding_size and budget_level for each vendor.
- Building a second table (vendor_options) to showcase twelve wedding options by combining the size and budget attributes.
- Ensuring the inclusion of vendors from all departments, with logical assumptions made when necessary.

The deliverable is a collection of SQL queries, designed with clear, well-organized comments to explain the rationale for category definitions and assumptions made when vendors are unavailable for certain combinations.
